Assignment 1: Create a game in which RNG defines a winner using C  
<=====================================>  
Files in Repository:  
	lrc.c --> Driver code for C  
	Makefile --> To compile lrc.c  
	Design.PDF --> Gives psuedocode/basic layout of program  
<------------------------------------->  
How to use program:  
	After running lrc.c you will be prompted with "Random Seed: ".    
Any number you input will be used as the seed for the RNG.   
After entering the seed you will be asked "How many players? ".   
You can only input numbers greater than 1 and less than 11. If you give an invalid number  
you will be prompted again. At this point the program will print who rolled and what their actions were until a winner is   reached! 

Error Checking: 
If you input a non int for random seed the message for how many players will print twice but will still run
If you enter a non int for number of players it will ask again
