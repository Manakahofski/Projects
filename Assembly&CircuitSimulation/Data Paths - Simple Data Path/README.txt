------------------------------------
LAB 2 :

-
 Use MML to construct a simple data path with a register file, ALU, and user inputs
------------------------------------
Files in dir:

-
 Lab2.lgi (MML document containing circuits)

------------------------------------
Instructions: All circuits are labled according to the flow diagram given in the Lab2 document. All circuits that are completed by me (the student) are past page 2
To run the circuit, press the green arrow at the top of the MML window to start the simulation, and clear all registers by pressing the button on page 1 labeled "Clear".
All testing should be done from page one, for no reason should you have to switch to any other page to test the circuits.
